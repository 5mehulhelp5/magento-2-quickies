## This is my Hot Fix for the Requested Qty GraphQl Error [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/33281)


Here, I am deleting the complete item from the cart as soon as I find qty error for the particular product. Instead of deleting you can set maximum available quantity as well. Comments welcome.
